# npm-run-script Plugin Documentation

This is a VS Code plugin for quickly running npm scripts. It also allows comments to be added to the scripts, making it convenient for developers to understand the functions of each script.

## Plugin Settings

* `terminal.single`: Whether to use the same terminal (Yes: only one terminal will be used to run commands; No: each command will open a new terminal).

## Known Issues

Currently none.

## Version Update Log

### 0.0.1

Initial release of the plugin.
